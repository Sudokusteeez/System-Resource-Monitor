# System-Resource-Monitor
# Overview:
The System Resource Monitor is a Python-based project designed to provide users with real-time insights into their system's performance and resource utilization. By monitoring CPU, memory, and disk usage, the monitor enables users to identify potential anomalies where performance bottlenecks and security threats could be present. 

# Languages & Programs Used: 
Python, Visual Studio Code, PSUtil & Time Libraries

# Purpose: 
The System Resource Monitor is designed to track CPU, memory, and disk usage, providing real-time visual representation through dynamic bars. The monitor continuously displays the system's health and generates warnings if resource usage exceeds certain thresholds, aiding in the identification of potential performance issues and resource-heavy applications.

# Key Features:
Real-time Resource Monitoring: The program continuously tracks CPU, memory, and disk usage, displaying the data in real-time using dynamic bars, allowing users to monitor resource utilization at a glance.

Warnings for High Usage: The monitor checks for resource usage above specific thresholds (90% for CPU and disk, 95% for memory) and displays warnings when the thresholds are exceeded.

# Skills Gained:

Proficiency in utilizing PSUtil and Time libraries for system resource monitoring and analysis.

Dynamic data visualization and real-time representation of system resource usage.

Understanding the implications of high resource usage and identifying resource-intensive applications.

Experience in creating a system resource monitor to optimize system performance.

# Usage:
*  Clone the repository to your local machine.
*  Install the required dependencies using pip.
*  Run the Python script to gather and display system information.
*  Observe the output as the script provides essential details about the system.
